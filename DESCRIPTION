Description: Tools for summarizing and selecting mixture models via dendrograms 
  constructed from overfitted latent mixing measures. The methods bridge 
  hierarchical clustering and mixture modeling, providing consistent selection 
  of mixture components and interpretable hierarchical structure discovery. 
  Includes functions for simulation, visualization, and applications such as 
  single-cell RNA-seq analysis.
