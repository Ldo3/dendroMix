# dendroMix

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dendroMix is to summarize and select mixture models via
dendrograms constructed from overfitted latent mixing measures. The
methods bridge hierarchical clustering and mixture modeling, providing
consistent selection of mixture components and interpretable
hierarchical structure discovery. Includes functions for simulation,
visualization, and applications such as single-cell RNA-seq analysis.
